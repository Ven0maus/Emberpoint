# Emberpoint [Work in progress] [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/b9d774n1ygvdo9cc/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Venom0us/emberpoint/branch/master)

## Story

You wake up in an abandoned house, the doors are locked and an evil creature lurks within.

Welcome to Emberpoint, an `ascii` based horror game with the sole purpose of surviving and finding
a way to escape from this place.

## Development

Emberpoint is an open-source, contribution project that is actively worked on.
We encourage people to create issues, and to actively work on this project during
events such as hacktoberfest. The idea is to create a working game, with a story for everyone, by everyone. 
You get to express your style, art and knowledge freely within this project.
